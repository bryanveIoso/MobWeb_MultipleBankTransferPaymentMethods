# MobWeb_MultipleBankTransferPaymentMethods extension for Magento

This simple extension adds four duplicates of the default "*Bank Transfer Payment*" payment method to Magento. These can then be enabled and configured individually, just like the default method.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Configuration

Go to *System -> Configuration -> Payment Methods* to enable and configure the four new payment methods (they're listed at the bottom).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
